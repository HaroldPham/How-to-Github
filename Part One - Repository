To start off, you'll be doing most of your work in the Repository tab where you'll be coding your programs into a "Repository."
  . Think of a Repository as a storage bin where you'll store your programs.
  . In Java terms, a "Java Project" folder.
  
Repository Syntax
  . When you make a Repository, it is traditional to turn on the "readme" check box so that the repository has a readme file for the description.
  
Importing and Exporting Files
  . Near the top right of the main Repository page you should find an add files tab. Select it and choose to either import files into your Repository or export one out.

Testing, testing, is this thing on?
